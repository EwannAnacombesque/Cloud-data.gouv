# Unlimited Cloud Storage on data.gouv.fr 
## The project
With [data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr/) API, this program makes you able to _freely store data of any type_ on data.gouv.fr. The site initially only allows text / spreadsheet files, with this program, you can upload whatever you want.  
You can either send files with my _API_ using api.py, or with the _GUI_ using gui.py.  
The official site [data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr/) urges you to respect its [GCU](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/terms/), I am **not** responsible for what you upload and do not encourage you to use this to store personal data.  
 
## How to use the Cloud 
+ First create an account on [data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr/) 
+ Then create an [organization](https://doc.data.gouv.fr/organisations/creer-une-organisation/)
+ Copy your API-KEY from your profile, and copy your organization ID (from your organization URL)
+ Paste those in the [INFOS.txt](INFOS.txt) file, first the API-KEY and then the ID on a new line

## The GUI

### Safe Mode
You can test the GUI by yourself without having to create an account and an organization with the safe mode, just specify when executing the gui.py file.
### Functionalities
The user is able to create and delete folders, download, upload and delete files in folders.
Everything is crystal clear, just enjoy the unlimited cloud storage.
